Key Features:

User Registration & Authentication:
Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles, enabling personalized recommendations and order history.

Book Search & Browsing:
Users can search books by title, author, genre, or ISBN. The browsing interface includes filters to refine search results based on categories and price ranges.

Shopping Cart & Wishlist:
Customers can add books to a shopping cart for immediate purchase or save them in a wishlist for future reference. Cart details, such as quantity and total price, are dynamically updated.

Order Management:
Users can place orders and choose payment methods. The system manages order processing, shipping details, and order tracking.

Book Details & Reviews:
Each book has a dedicated page showing detailed information, including a description, author bio, user ratings, and reviews. Users can rate and review books theyâ€™ve purchased.

Admin Panel:
Admins can manage the inventory by adding, updating, or removing books, viewing sales reports, and managing user accounts and order statuses.

Database Integration:
The project uses a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store book details, user information, and order history securely. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is used for communication between the Java application and the database.

Responsive Design:
The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility on different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Technologies Used:

Java SE for core functionality
JDBC for database connectivity
JSP/Servlets for dynamic web content
MySQL for database management
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end design
Apache Tomcat as the server
